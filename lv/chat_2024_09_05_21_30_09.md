1. **You**: in python oops polymorphism write example for method overrinding
2. **ChatGPT**: Polymorphism in object-oriented programming allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Method overriding is a form of polymorphism where a method in a subclass has the same name and signature as a method in its superclass. Here's an example in Python to demonstrate method overriding:

```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Generic animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark bark!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        print("Meow meow!")

# Create instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Call the make_sound method on instances
dog.make_sound()  # Output: Bark bark!
cat.make_sound()  # Output: Meow meow!
```

In this example:
- We have a superclass `Animal` with a method `make_sound` that prints a generic animal sound.
- We have two subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` that inherit from the `Animal` class and override the `make_sound` method with their own specific sounds.
- When we create instances of `Dog` and `Cat`, and call the `make_sound` method on them, the overridden method corresponding to each subclass is executed.

This demonstrates polymorphism through method overriding where objects of different classes (`Dog` and `Cat`) are treated as objects of a common superclass (`Animal`) but exhibit different behaviors based on their specific implementations.

4. **ChatGPT**: Sure! Let's write a simple example in Python. We'll create a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string. This is a basic example that showcases string manipulation and loops. 

### Example: Counting Vowels in a String

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We want to take a string input from the user and count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present in that string.

2. **Setting Up**: Weâ€™ll use a function for our logic. The function will loop through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Get input from the user.
   - Create a function called `count_vowels`.
   - Define a list of vowels.
   - Loop through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel.
   - Return the total count.

### Code Sample:

```python
def count_vowels(input_string):
    # Define the vowels
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is a vowel
            
    return count

# Get input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# Call the function and print the result
vowel_count = count_vowels(user_input)
print(f"The number of vowels in the string is: {vowel_count}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `count_vowels` that takes a parameter `input_string`.

2. **Vowel List**: We create a string `vowels` that contains all the vowels in both lowercase and uppercase.

3. **Looping Through String**: Using a `for` loop, we examine each character in the `input_string`.

4. **Checking for Vowels**: Inside the loop, we check if the character is in our `vowels` string. If it is, we increment our `count` variable.

5. **Returning the Count**: After checking all characters, we return the total count of vowels.

6. **User Input**: We use `input()` to allow the user to enter a string.

7. **Output**: Finally, we print the result showing how many vowels were found in the user's input.

### Running the Program:
- When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a string.
- After you type in a string and hit enter, it will display how many vowels were in that string.

6. **ChatGPT**: Certainly! Here's another example in Python showing how we can calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Taking input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Checking if the number is negative
if num < 0:
    print("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
else:
    result = factorial(num)
    print("The factorial of", num, "is", result)
```

In this code snippet, we define a recursive function `factorial()` that calculates the factorial of a given number. We then take input from the user, check if the number is negative, and then calculate and display the factorial if the number is non-negative.
